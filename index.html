							<p>Graduated from Westfield State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and magna cum laude distinction in December of 2016.</p>

							<p align="center">&#9863&#9863&#9863&#9863&#9863</p>
							<p>Aside from work and school, I enjoy everything that has to do with the outdoors. Fishing, soccer, birdwatching, gardening and other related activities. </p>
							<p>I also enjoy the peace and quite of doing astrophotography and macro-photography. I plans to setup a page to feature my photographs in the near future.</p>

							<p>
								As an intern at 3M I cooperated with software engineers, database engineers, clinical analysts, and data analysts to integrate new features and improvements to internal Java managed web application. 
							</p>
							<p>
								We worked in an agile environment to continuously deliver and showcase new features to our product owners.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also worked with the team to improve our productivity and efficiency by developing services that would minimize tedious work. 
							</p>
							<p>
								One of those services was designed to automate the testing of our web apps. The service utlize the Firefox's Selenium plugin automated the process of checking our site for any broken pages.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was one of the cooler project that I worked on, mostly because of how different and new it was to me.

							<p>
								At CIT - a department under Westfield State University that support and train faculty with online classes, I was tasked with the construction of interactive learning objects with an aim to promote online learning. 
							</p>
							<p>
								My work here began with the assistance of the Adobe Edge software, which made the process of programming much easier. But as I progressed, my projects relied less on the software and more towards the code that I wrote in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
							</p> 
							<p> 
								I brought more functionalities and creativeness to my projects, and in turn produced more effective learning resources for students to utilize in their online learning environment. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Aside from learning new technologies - Edge Animate, Dream Weaver and languages - HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, I also got the opportunity to take on new challenges outside of my comfort zone. With every hour I spent on each project, an equivalent hour was used to develop my own applications that encompassed my collective understanding of online learning and web development.

								Digit is a simple Android game that test the user's response time.
							</p>
							<p>
								Having worn many digital watches as a kid, I often play with the stopwatch function on my Casio F-91W. That experience sparked the idea for this game. 
							</p>
							<p>
								The concept is to start the timer, then try to stop it at exactly '00' milliseconds. This application simplify that concept with the digital watch and apply it to single digit numbers.

								Built with Android Studio, and Java
